CSS counters:
------------
.CSS counters are like "variables". 
.The variable values can be incremented by CSS rules. 
(which will track how many times they are used).

To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties:
.counter-reset                - Creates or resets a counter
.counter-increment            - Increments a counter value
.content                      - Inserts generated content
.counter() or counters() function - Adds the value of a counter to an element

To use a CSS counter, it must first be created with counter-reset.
